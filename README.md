# wavy_numbers
A fun side-project which prints out wavy numbers (or blocks, depending on your choice) in your native terminal.

It is dynamic: you can resize your terminal window at any time and the program will re-calculate and make the numbers/blocks bounce off the walls of your terminal accordingly.
