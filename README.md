# wavy_numbers
A fun side-project which prints out wavy numbers (or blocks, depending on your choice) in your native terminal.

It is dynamic: you can resize your terminal window at any time and the program will re-calculate and make the numbers/blocks bounce off the walls of your terminal accordingly.

**The final code: [```wavy_numbers_dynamic.py```](https://github.com/dippudo/wavy_numbers/blob/main/wavy_numbers_dynamic.py)**
